## Technical Implementation Details

### QR Scanner Implementation

The QR code scanner is a critical component of our submission that allows users to easily claim tokens by scanning referral codes. Here's how we implemented it:

#### Component Architecture

```typescript
// QR Scanner Component Structure
export function QRScanner({ onCodeScanned, onClose }: QRScannerProps) {
  const scannerContainerId = "qr-reader";
  const [isScanning, setIsScanning] = useState(false);
  const [error, setError] = useState<string | null>(null);
  const [permissionGranted, setPermissionGranted] = useState(false);
  const scannerRef = useRef<Html5Qrcode | null>(null);
  
  // Camera and scanner management logic
  // Permission handling
  // QR processing
}
```

#### Technical Features

1. **HTML5 Camera Integration**: We use the `html5-qrcode` library to access the device camera securely through browser APIs.

2. **Permission Management**: The scanner implements robust camera permission handling with appropriate UI feedback states:
   ```typescript
   const startScanner = async () => {
     try {
       await requestCameraPermission();
       setPermissionGranted(true);
       // Scanner initialization logic
     } catch (err) {
       setError("Camera access denied. Please grant permission and try again.");
     }
   };
   ```

3. **QR Code Processing**: When a QR code is detected, we process it using a dedicated utility:
   ```typescript
   // in referral-qrcode.ts
   export function parseReferralData(data: string): {
     referralCode?: string;
     campaignId?: string;
     campaignName?: string;
   } | null {
     // Logic to parse different QR code formats
     // Handles both URL formats and direct codes
   }
   ```

4. **Multi-Format Support**: The scanner can process:
   - Direct referral codes
   - Full URLs with campaign parameters
   - Deep links with encoded referral information

### Airdrop Mode Implementation

The airdrop feature allows token distribution without requiring referral codes:

#### State Management

```typescript
// State for tracking airdrop mode
const [isAirdropMode, setIsAirdropMode] = useState(false);

// Toggle function with appropriate state resets
const toggleAirdropMode = () => {
  setIsAirdropMode(!isAirdropMode);
  setClaimCode(''); // Clear claim code when switching modes
  setError(null);   // Clear any previous errors
  
  // Additional state cleanup logic
};
```

#### Conditional Rendering

The UI dynamically adapts based on the active mode:

```tsx
{!isAirdropMode ? (
  <div className="space-y-2">
    {/* Referral code input with QR scanner button */}
  </div>
) : (
  <div className="text-center p-4 bg-black/20 rounded-lg">
    <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold">Airdrop Mode Active</h3>
    <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground">
      Connect your wallet and click "Claim Airdrop" below.
    </p>
  </div>
)}
```

#### Transaction Logic

The form submission handler adapts based on the active mode:

```typescript
const handleSubmit = async (e: FormEvent) => {
  e.preventDefault();
  // ... validation logic
  
  if (isAirdropMode) {
    // Airdrop claim logic
    tokenToClaimAddress = AIRDROP_MINT_ADDRESS;
    finalEventDetailsForSuccessView = { 
      name: "Community Airdrop", 
      mint: AIRDROP_MINT_ADDRESS 
    };
  } else {
    // Referral claim logic
    // Uses claimCode and/or eventDetails
  }
  
  // Proceed with token transfer
};
```

## ZK Compression Integration

ZK (Zero Knowledge) Compression powers the token transfer system in Droploop:

### Technical Implementation

1. **Compressed Token Transfers**: 
   ```typescript
   export async function transferCompressedTokens(
     connection: Connection,
     payer: Keypair,
     mintAddress: PublicKey,
     amount: number,
     owner: Keypair,
     destination: PublicKey
   ): Promise<string> {
     // Light Protocol integration for compressed token transfers
   }
   ```

2. **Keypair Management**: We implemented a secure approach for managing the admin keypair:
   ```typescript
   export function getAdminKeypair(): Keypair | null {
     try {
       // Environment-based configuration
       const privateKeyBase58 = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_ADMIN_PRIVATE_KEY;
       if (!privateKeyBase58) return null;
       
       // Convert base58 private key to Uint8Array
       const privateKeyBytes = decode(privateKeyBase58);
       return Keypair.fromSecretKey(new Uint8Array(privateKeyBytes));
     } catch (error) {
       console.error('Error creating admin keypair:', error);
       return null;
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Demo Mode**: For hackathon demonstration purposes, we implemented a demo mode in `transactions.ts`:
   ```typescript
   // Determines if we use real or simulated transactions
   const DEMO_MODE = true;
   
   // Simulation logic for demo presentations
   if (DEMO_MODE) {
     await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 1500));
     const fakeSig = Array.from({length: 64}, () => 
       "0123456789abcdef"[Math.floor(Math.random() * 16)]).join('');
     return fakeSig;
   }
   ```

## Core Functionality

### Campaign Creation

The campaign creation flow uses Light Protocol's compressed token standard to create cost-effective referral campaigns on Solana:

1. Creator connects their Solana wallet via the wallet adapter
2. Creator fills out campaign details in the creation form (name, description, rewards, etc.)
3. Application creates a referral campaign using Light Protocol's SDK for compression
4. QR codes and referral links are generated for distribution

### Referral Processing

The referral process works as follows:

1. New user scans a QR code or enters a referral code
2. Application validates the referral against the blockchain
3. User connects their wallet to join the campaign
4. Both the referrer and the new user receive compressed tokens as rewards

### Referral Tracking

The referral tracking system provides:

1. Real-time statistics on campaign performance
2. Conversion rate analytics for each referrer
3. Historical data on reward distributions
4. Personalized referral dashboard for each participant

## Technical Implementation Details

### Wallet Integration

The application uses Solana wallet adapters to connect to various Solana wallets. The wallet connection is managed through the `WalletProvider` component, which wraps the application and provides wallet context to all components.

### Compressed Tokens for Rewards

Light Protocol's state compression technology is used to create and transfer reward tokens at a fraction of the cost of traditional Solana tokens. This enables economically viable referral programs by:

- Storing referral and reward data in a Merkle tree
- Using zero-knowledge proofs for verification
- Reducing on-chain storage requirements by up to 1000x
- Enabling bulk reward distribution with minimal gas fees

### UI Framework

The UI is built with:

- Tailwind CSS for styling
- shadcn/ui for component primitives
- Responsive design principles for mobile compatibility
